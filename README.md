# 🧠 ProFeed: Professor AI Co-Author Feedback Tool

A web-based tool designed to help professors provide personalized, course-specific feedback in asynchronous college classes by co-authoring with AI. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with optional integration to a LangChain-powered backend.

## 💡 Project Vision

Students in asynchronous online classes often wait days for feedback—or never get personalized help at all. ProfAI helps bridge that gap by letting professors upload rubrics and comments once, and letting AI assist in drafting personalized feedback for student submissions. Professors stay in control. Students stay supported.
